when i click on a number....

given a number is already displayed
then the digits should be concatenated.

given i have not pressed the decimal
then that number should appear on the display.

given i have pressed the decimal
then that number should be concatenated on the end of the currently displayed number.

given i have a pending operation
then that operator should operate on the displayed number and the number just pressed
And the number just pressed should be displayed.

when i click on an arithmetic operator...

then it should queue the indicated operation to operate on the number that is displayed and the number about to be clicked.
And it displays any queued calculation.

when i click on clear...

then queued operations and calculations are cleared and display is reset to zero.

when i click on equal...

then queued operations are calculated.
And the display is set to the calculation.
